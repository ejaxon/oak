# Development Principles & Standards

## Coding Standards
We use the [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Architecture Principles

* __We Will Get It Wrong__: Technology moves quickly and requirements can evolve equally quickly, so the chances that any choice of framework or infrastructure will remain optimal over a long time is close to zero. The application architecture must be designed to minimize the pain of migrating to or integrating new technologies. This means that, while we may choose a framework or infrastructure that will lock us in for a significant period, we may only do that when the benefits clearly outweigh the nearly inevitable cost of switching later.
